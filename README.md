# DermAI
 DermAI is a fully offline skin disease identifying device which will provide accurate predictions to users when they input an image of their affected area.

## Problem Motivation
Skin diseases are reported to be the 4th leading cause of disability worldwide, but with the limited number and distribution of dermatologists, it is nearly impossible to provide adequate care to everyone in need using traditional methods.
Thus, the implementation of long-range technological support tools has been growing in an effort to provide quality dermatology care to even the most remote settings globally. DermAI is an effort to provide this long-reange support for skin diseases.
