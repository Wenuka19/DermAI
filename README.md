# DermAI

## Introduction
 DermAI is a fully offline skin disease identifying device which will provide accurate predictions to users when they input an image of their affected area. This is built using a Raspberry PI computer<br>

### Problem Motivation
Skin diseases are reported to be the 4th leading cause of disability worldwide, but with the limited number and distribution of dermatologists, it is nearly impossible to provide adequate care to everyone in need using traditional methods.
Thus, the implementation of long-range technological support tools has been growing in an effort to provide quality dermatology care to even the most remote settings globally. DermAI is an effort to provide this long-reange support for skin diseases.

### Main Components

**Raspberry PI Camera** <br>
This is used to take a picture of the infected skin area and send it to the Raspberry pi computer.

**Raspberry Pi Computer** <br>
This unit contains a trained Machine Learning Model that can classify skin disease images. It will receive the image and display the identified result along with the reasoning for the prediction.
